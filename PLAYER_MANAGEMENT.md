# Real-time Player Management Improvements

## üîß **Fixed Issues:**

### **1. Live Player List Updates**
- ‚úÖ **Real-time synchronization** - Player list updates instantly across all browser tabs
- ‚úÖ **Immediate removal** - Players are removed from all tabs when they leave or close browser
- ‚úÖ **Reliable cleanup** - Multiple mechanisms ensure players don't get "stuck" in the list

### **2. Enhanced Leave Detection**
- **Heartbeat System**: Players send a "heartbeat" every 10 seconds to show they're active
- **Multiple Event Listeners**: 
  - `beforeunload` - When user closes tab/navigates away
  - `pagehide` - When page becomes hidden (mobile browsers)
  - `visibilitychange` - When user switches tabs (with delay to avoid false positives)
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Server-side cleanup removes inactive players every 15 seconds

### **3. Database Schema Updates**
- **New Column**: `last_seen` timestamp to track player activity
- **Graceful Fallback**: Code works even if database column doesn't exist yet
- **Indexes**: Optimized queries for better performance

## üöÄ **How It Works:**

### **Join Game Flow:**
1. User signs in and clicks "Join Game"
2. Player record created with current timestamp
3. Heartbeat starts immediately (every 10 seconds)
4. Real-time subscription notifies all other players

### **Leave Game Flow:**
1. **Manual Leave**: Click "Leave Game" button ‚Üí immediate removal
2. **Close Tab**: Multiple event listeners trigger cleanup
3. **Inactive Detection**: If heartbeat stops, player removed after 30 seconds
4. **Periodic Cleanup**: Background process removes stale players every 15 seconds

### **Real-time Updates:**
- **Supabase Realtime**: All clients subscribe to player table changes
- **Instant Sync**: Any player join/leave triggers immediate UI updates across all tabs
- **Conflict Resolution**: Database handles concurrent operations safely

## üõ† **Technical Implementation:**

### **Heartbeat System:**
```javascript
// Updates player's last_seen timestamp every 10 seconds
setInterval(updateHeartbeat, 10000)
```

### **Multi-layer Cleanup:**
```javascript
// 1. Event listeners for browser events
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload)
window.addEventListener('pagehide', handleBeforeUnload) 
window.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange)

// 2. Periodic cleanup of inactive players
setInterval(cleanupInactivePlayers, 15000)

// 3. Component unmount cleanup
useEffect(() => () => removePlayer(), [])
```

### **Real-time Subscriptions:**
```javascript
// Subscribe to all player table changes
supabase.channel('public:players')
  .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', table: 'players' }, updatePlayers)
```

## üìù **Database Schema Changes:**
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Add last_seen column for heartbeat tracking
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_seen timestamptz DEFAULT now();

-- Create index for efficient cleanup queries  
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_players_last_seen ON players(last_seen);
```

## ‚úÖ **Expected Behavior:**
- **Join**: Player appears instantly in all browser tabs
- **Leave Button**: Player removed immediately from all tabs
- **Close Tab**: Player removed within 2-30 seconds from all tabs
- **Network Issues**: Player removed after missing 3+ heartbeats (30+ seconds)
- **Browser Crash**: Player removed by periodic cleanup (max 15 seconds delay)

The system now provides **robust, real-time player management** that handles all edge cases and ensures the player list stays accurate across all connected clients.
